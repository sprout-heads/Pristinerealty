                <h4>Our Specialized Service - Dental Implant Surgery</h4>
                <p>It is a surgical procedure involving the replacement of damaged or missing teeth with artificial ones that have aesthetics and function much like the natural ones. Dental implant surgery offers a much more efficient and hassle-free alternative to ill-fitting dentures or bridgework.</p>
                <p>The type of dental surgery to be performed depends on various factors like the condition of the jawbones, the type of teeth to be replaced, the type of aesthetic requirement, and the present condition of your jawbone. The placement of the implant inside your jaw bone is followed by healing of normal bone tightly around the implant giving it a natural tooth root like an anchor. I is then followed by placement of artificial crowns of teeth to be replaced.</p>
